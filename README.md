`fishRman` is an Open-Source Shiny R Dashboard to easily query, download, analyse and visualise Global Fishing Watch data on fishing effort.

## How to become a contributor
First things first, you might want to take a look at the Issues page. There, I listed some tasks that I reckon the project needs. If you don't find anything that you can do, you can still run the code and make up **your own** opinion on what is needed. From there, you can either file this new Issue and forget about it, or file it and handle it yourself. The pull requests should be made onto the `pull-requests` branch.
