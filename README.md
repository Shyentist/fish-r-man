My intent for this project is to build a Shiny R app to allow people to easily query and analyze Global Fishing Watch data without any prior knowledge of R, SQL, and BigQuery.

I have already independent snippets to analyze the fishing effort, some others to handle GFW data, and some others that belongs to the Shiny R bit.
I want to make them clear and understandable (and most of all, well inserted in the workflow) before uploading them to the repo.
