# Welcome to fishRman
## Intent
fishRman is a Shiny R Web Application/Dashboard that allows people to easily query and analyze Global Fishing Watch data without any prior knowledge of R, SQL, and BigQuery.

## Motive
I tend to query and analyze this kind of data often, and usually find myself fiddling with some variables before re-running the code. This got me thinking: "*I could just write an app that makes the whole experience more enjoyable*".

## OK, but why Open-Source?
Why not? I would definitely not market this anyway, so I might as well enjoy the perks of cooperation, learning from other contributors to the project, and from the experience itself.

## How to become a contributor
First things first, you might want to take a look at the Issues page. There, I listed some tasks that I reckon the project needs. If you don't find anything that you can do, you can still run the code and make up **your own** opinion on what is needed. From there, you can either file this new Issue and forget about it, or file it and handle it yourself. The pull requests should be made onto the `pull-requests` branch.
